# CSS TRANSITIONS

In this task, I created a simple ID card that has a profile picture and some personal information.

I added some css 2D transforms, scale & screw on hover

scale- I added transform: scale(2,3); to the profile picture. This makes the image move two times of its original width, and three times of its original height

skew- I added transform: skew(20deg,20deg); to the container. This skews the container 20 degrees along the X-axis, and 20 degrees along the Y-axis

Added transition to both of them to make a smooth movement over a given duration.
